# Upsampling_techniques_during_cross-validation
 
We compare the following cases:

1. Random oversampling, then cross-validation.
2. Random oversampling during cross-validation.
3. Oversampling through SMOTE during cross-validation.

We work with a dataset from LendingClub and two classifiers: decision trees and logistic regression.
